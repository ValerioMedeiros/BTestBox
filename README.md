# BTestBox
 It is a tool to automatically test the translation of B in another language. BTestBox takes a target language and a B implementation as input and generate
 a test case to compare the execution of the translated B code and the B implementation. The tool uses ProB to animate the B implementation and get the expected states.


# Installation procedure
The installation of BTestBox in Atelier-B is similar in Windows,
Linux and OS X. It is performed the script file configAtelierB.py,
